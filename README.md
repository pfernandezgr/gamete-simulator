# gamete-simulator

Unveil populations structure is essential in plant breeding and genetic resources conservation. When bulk sampling and DNA fingerprinting is applied in outbreeding species, allelic frequencies are obtained. To further analyze population structure, the simulation of haploid gametes from unlinked markers, complying with the observed allele frequencies avoids bias since it not assumes population equilibrium. This routine simulates gametes enabling the Bayesian analysis of population structure.
